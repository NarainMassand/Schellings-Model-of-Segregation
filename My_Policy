Just Moving Around - I call this policy - “Just Moving Around”. The main intent while designing this policy was to only provide the agent with local vision I.e. ‘0’ global vision. The agent decides its movement only by seeing a neighborhood of pxp. If the difference between number of same and opposite agents in this area is less than a certain number(diff), the agent checks for the same condition at the empty location’s in the same neighborhood and moves to the one that ensures maximum difference in same and opposite types of agents in corresponding surrounding. If no empty location in the neighborhood, the agent doesn’t move. If the difference between the same and opposite agents is bigger than a number, it still doesn’t move.
